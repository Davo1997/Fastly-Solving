# Fastly-Solving
This is a repository where are functions for fastly counting any power of inserted number, any factorial of number etc.

=== FAST POWER FUNCTION ===

In this function you can insert the number as a float, but power as integer, any power less than zero will raise "Please enter the 'power' as equal or more than ZERO !".

=== FAST FACTORIAL FUNCTION ===

This function can fastly count any numbers fuctorial up to 100.000 and more (in ex. of 100.000 it works in 5-10 seconds).
Because of working with lists - the function can't count factorial of 1.000.000 in 1 second (it will take memory for 1.000.000 numbers factorials) and after 1-2 minutes will raise an error. 
Please NOTICE ! It's fastly counting big numbers, but don't wait the counting process more than 30 seconds...
